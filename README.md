# Visualization Project: 2D Puzzles and 3D Procedural Terrain Generation

This CSC 415 project focuses on gaining a better grasp of generating/visualizing 2D puzzles
and 3D terrains.

# About Custom Modules

This project uses the `pygame`, `mathplotlib`, `perlin_noise`, obtained through `pip` and tested
with Python 3.

# Compilation of the Visualization Project

To compile the 2D portion of the project, please use the following:

"""
cd final/2D
python3 driver.py
"""

To compile the 3D portion of the project, please use the following:

"""
cd final/3D
python3 perlin.py > output
python3 display_perlin.py
"""
